// Shared gate for the tier-3 specs that need OPTIONAL model weights which
// upstream does not ship: the sharded fp32 encoder and
// the speaker-diarization models. Historically each such spec self-SKIPPED when
// its weights were not served, so a weightless run stayed green. The problem:
// on a box that is SUPPOSED to have the full model set (a maintainer's local
// checkout), a silent skip hides "I thought I tested fp32 but actually tested
// nothing" behind a passing run.
//
// So: a missing weight is a FAILURE locally (where the full set is expected) and
// a SKIP in CI (which only fetches the int8 ASR + diarization set, never the
// fp32 shards or the lite encoder -- see scripts/fetch-e2e-models.mjs).
//
// strict resolution (strictWeights):
//   - PARAKEET_E2E_STRICT_WEIGHTS explicitly set -> honour it
//     ('0' / 'false' / 'no' / 'off' => lenient; anything else => strict)
//   - otherwise                                  -> strict when NOT in CI
//     (process.env.CI is unset), lenient in CI.
//
// This module imports NOTHING from Playwright so it stays a pure, tier-1-unit-
// testable helper; the spec passes its own `test` object into
// requireWeightsOrSkip so we can still emit a real Playwright skip.
//
// Built with Claude Code.
