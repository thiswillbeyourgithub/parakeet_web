# definitions: a forward reference returns 127 ("command not found"),
# and inside an `if ! cmd; then ... fi` that 127 inverts to true and
# fires the error branch. The previous layout placed _validate_regex_source
# below its caller, so the container exited 1 on every startup with no
# diagnostic. Same issue would have struck _validate_csp_hosts. Keep
# every helper inside this block.

# redirect to e.g. http://169.254.169.254/... (cloud instance metadata)
# or an operator typo of file://... would be silently followed and the

# ---------- Runtime VITE_* config injection --------------------------------
# /srv is read-only at runtime, so config.js lives on a tmpfs at /run/config
# and Caddy serves it via the matching `handle /config.js` route.
mkdir -p /run/config
# Build config.js by JSON-encoding each value via node. The previous
# double-quoted heredoc let any value containing a quote, backslash, or
# $(...) break out of the JS string literal — an operator setting e.g.
# VITE_MODEL_REPO='";alert(1)//' would inject JS into every served page.
# node is already in the image (signaling sidecar), so this is free.
#
# IMPORTANT INVARIANT: the generated file is served as an EXTERNAL
# <script src="/config.js"> in index.html and remote-mic.html.
# JSON.stringify does not escape "</script>", U+2028, or U+2029, so
# inlining the config into HTML would turn an operator-set value such
# as VITE_ANALYTICS_URL=...</script><script>alert(1)// into XSS for
# every visitor. We still post-process the output (defense in depth)
# so that even if a future refactor inlines the config, it stays safe.
