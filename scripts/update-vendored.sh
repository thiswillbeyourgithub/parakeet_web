# Update locally vendored npm dependencies to the versions pinned in
# app/ui/vendor/package.json. That manifest is the single source of truth for
# vendored versions: Dependabot watches it (CVE alerts + bump PRs), so to
# upgrade, bump the pin there (or merge the Dependabot PR) then run this.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/update-vendored.sh                  # update all npm-vendored deps
#   ./scripts/update-vendored.sh preact           # update only preact
#   ./scripts/update-vendored.sh onnxruntime-web  # update only onnxruntime-web
#
# Does NOT update app/ui/vendor/dictation_support/ because the upstream is
# git-only (GoogleChromeLabs/dictation_support) and requires running their
# build to produce dist/index.js. Refresh that one by hand per the procedure
# in app/ui/vendor/dictation_support/SOURCE.md.
#
# Per CLAUDE.md, this script must only be run when the user explicitly asks
# for a vendored-deps refresh. Run it from the repo root.
#
# Note for future Claude sessions: this script does **not** sync parakeet.js
# (app/src/). That code is a fork of ysdede/parakeet.js, not an npm vendor,
# so the registry-tarball flow below does not apply. The recurring
# upstream-sync runbook for parakeet.js lives in app/src/SOURCE.md under
# "Upstream sync runbook"; the per-round triage backlog lives in
# TEMP_PLAN.md at the repo root (gitignored). Run a parakeet.js sync round
# only when the user explicitly asks; pick up where the previous round left
# off using the "Last upstream commit triaged" SHA recorded in
# app/src/SOURCE.md.
